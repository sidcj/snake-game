# snake-game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game recreated using Python and Tkinter, a GUI library for building desktop applications. This project provides an interactive gaming experience where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen boundaries.
